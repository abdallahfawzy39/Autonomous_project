This is my autonomous systems course project. It is focused on autonomous aspects for Husky and turtlebot3 on Gazebo. It has 4 milestones.

Milestone1: Setting different velocities on Husky bot 
Milestone2: Setting a goal Position for turtlebot3. 
Milestone3: Creating a map and implementing BFS and DFS path planning algorithms. 
Milestone4: Introducing noise and then impementing kalman filter to try it.
